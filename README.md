MoiSite is a platform built to generate you a responsive and lightweight personal-website in seconds.

### Extremely Important
_TL;DR: Moisite is no longer supported._
Please read the full announcement at https://jacobsammon.com/moisite/news.

If you'd like to take over the project, please get in touch.

MoiSite is well documented over at https://jacobsammon.com/moisite/docs, and you can find an installation guide at https://jacobsammon.com/moisite/docs/0.0.3/install.

Version 1.0.0 of MoiSite is coming soon. It'll have a brand new and more modern frontend, with the same/similar easy-to-use backend.
